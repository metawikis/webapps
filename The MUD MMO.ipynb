        "protagonist_elements = {\n",
        "    \"Name\": \"The name of the protagonist is usually the first thing that we learn about them. It can give us clues about their personality, their background, or their role in the story. For example, the name \"Harry Potter\" suggests that he is a powerful wizard, while the name \"Katniss Everdeen\" suggests that she is a strong and independent young woman.\",\n",
        "    \"Age\": \"The age of the protagonist can also tell us a lot about them. A young protagonist may be more inexperienced and naive, while an older protagonist may be more experienced and wise. For example, the protagonist of \"The Hunger Games\" is 16 years old, while the protagonist of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is 6 years old.\",\n",
        "    \"Gender\": \"The gender of the protagonist can also affect the way that we relate to them. A male protagonist may be more relatable to male readers, while a female protagonist may be more relatable to female readers. However, it is important to remember that not all readers will fit neatly into these categories. For example, the protagonist of \"The Book Thief\" is a young girl, but she is relatable to readers of all genders.\",\n",
        "    \"Appearance\": \"The appearance of the protagonist can also give us clues about their personality. For example, a protagonist who is described as being beautiful may be more confident and outgoing, while a protagonist who is described as being plain may be more shy and introverted. However, it is important to remember that appearance is not always an accurate reflection of personality. For example, the protagonist of \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\" is a young boy who is described as being autistic, but he is also very intelligent and curious.\",\n",
        "    \"Personality\": \"The personality of the protagonist is one of the most important elements of a novel. It is what makes them relatable and interesting. A well-developed protagonist will have a unique personality that is shaped by their experiences, their goals, and their values. For example, the protagonist of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a young man named Holden Caulfield who is cynical and rebellious. He is struggling to find his place in the world and he is trying to figure out who he is.\",\n",
        "    \"Goals\": \"The protagonist of a novel usually has a goal that they are striving to achieve. This goal can be anything from finding love to saving the world. The goal gives the protagonist something to work towards and it helps to drive the plot of the story. For example, the protagonist of \"The Lord of the Rings\" is Frodo Baggins, who is tasked with destroying the One Ring.\",\n",
        "    \"Motivations\": \"The motivations of the protagonist are what drive them to achieve their goals. These motivations can be complex and they can change over the course of the story. For example, the protagonist of \"The Great Gatsby\" is Jay Gatsby, who is motivated by his love for Daisy Buchanan.\",\n",
        "    \"Flaws\": \"No protagonist is perfect. They all have flaws that make them human and relatable. These flaws can be anything from being shy to being arrogant. For example, the protagonist of \"Pride and Prejudice\" is Elizabeth Bennet, who is proud and independent.\",\n",
        "    \"Strengths\": \"In addition to their flaws, protagonists also have strengths that help them to overcome challenges. These strengths can be anything from being intelligent to being brave. For example, the protagonist of \"The Hunger Games\" is Katniss Everdeen, who is a skilled archer and hunter.\",\n",
        "    \"Relationships\": \"The protagonist's relationships with other characters can also help to shape their personality and their development. These relationships can be positive or negative, and they can be romantic, platonic, or familial. For example, the protagonist of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is Scout Finch, who has a close relationship with her father, Atticus.\",\n",
        "    \"Conflict\": \"Every novel has conflict. This conflict can be internal or external, and it can be physical or emotional. The conflict is what drives the plot of the story and it helps to test the protagonist's strength and resilience. For example, the protagonist of \"The Lord of the Rings\" faces internal conflict as he struggles with his doubts and fears, and he also faces external conflict as he battles the forces of evil.\",\n",
        "    \"Growth\": \"Over the course of the novel, the protagonist should grow and change. This growth can be physical, emotional, or intellectual. The growth helps the protagonist to become a better person and it helps them to achieve their goals. For example, the protagonist of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" grows from being a cynical and rebellious teenager to a more hopeful and optimistic young man.\",\n",

The dataset contains text from novels that have been annotated with information about the entities and relationships in the novels.
